# Rice Cooker Simulator

This simple Rice Cooker Simulator allows users to interact with a virtual rice cooker through a console-based menu. The simulator offers various functionalities such as adding rice, cooking rice, steaming, keeping warm, and removing rice.

## Functionality Overview

### Time Complexity Analysis

1. **addRice Function:**
   - Time Complexity: O(1)
   - Simple conditional checks and console.log statements result in constant time execution.

2. **cookRice Function:**
   - Time Complexity: O(1)
   - Similar to `addRice`, involving simple conditional checks, console.log statements, and a delay function with a constant time complexity.

3. **steam Function:**
   - Time Complexity: O(1)
   - Involves simple conditional checks, console.log statements, and a delay function with a constant time complexity.

4. **keepWarm Function:**
   - Time Complexity: O(1)
   - Similar to the previous functions, involving simple conditional checks, console.log statements, and constant time complexity.

5. **removeRice Function:**
   - Time Complexity: O(1)
   - Involves conditional checks and console.log statements with constant time complexity.

6. **delaySync Function:**
   - Time Complexity: O(n)
   - The `delaySync` function has a linear time complexity due to the while loop, with 'n' as the input parameter 'ms'.

7. **simulateRiceCooker Function:**
   - Time Complexity: O(k)
   - Depends on the number of iterations in the do-while loop, where 'k' is the number of user interactions.

### Space Complexity Analysis

1. **riceCooker Object:**
   - Space Complexity: O(1)
   - The properties of the `riceCooker` object (`ricePresent`, `riceCooked`, `steamingInProgress`, `heatingInProgress`) use constant space.

2. **simulateRiceCooker Function:**
   - Space Complexity: O(1)
   - Uses constant space as it declares a few local variables (`input`, `stacks`), and the overall space complexity is not affected by the input size.

## Conclusion

The provided Rice Cooker Simulator code is well-optimized for the given functionality, with most functions having a constant time complexity of O(1). The `delaySync` function introduces a linear time complexity of O(n) based on the input parameter 'ms'. The overall space complexity remains constant at O(1), providing efficient performance for the simulated tasks.

Feel free to explore and interact with the Rice Cooker Simulator. Thank you for using the simulator!
